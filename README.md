# Analysis-of-Machine-Learning-models-for-Botnet-Detection

Submitted as a report of the study of Botnet Detction using Machine Learning models, this report provides an in-depth exploration of botnets, their characteristics, and the existing research in the field of botnet detection. The primary objective of this study is to assess preprocessing techniques such as variance thresholding and one-hot encoding for refining the botnet dataset, along with feature selection methods like filter and wrapper to enhance the performance of machine learning models. The paper compares the performance of these models in predicting accuracy and anomalies on the network dataset. The employed machine learning algorithms include Random Forest, Extra Trees, Logistic Regression, and Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in distinguishing useful traffic from junk traffic. Ultimately, the optimal model is identified through rigorous testing on a dataset of attacks and comparative performance analysis.
